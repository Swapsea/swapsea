Welcome to the 2021/22 Season at North Bondi!

Swapsea is very glad to be back again this season to provide all your patrol swap needs. :-)

What is Swapsea?
Swapsea is an online roster management system for Surf Life Saving Clubs and will allow you to swap your patrols with other club members during the season. Swapsea will also remind you of upcoming patrols (by email) and you can even link your roster to your smartphone calendar.

How do you get a patrol swap?
You can get a swap for your patrol by logging into Swapsea and either creating Requests and waiting for other members to make an Offer, or you can make an offer on someone else's request. You can only create one request per patrol, but make as many offers as you like.

Next Steps?
Before you can login, you will need to activate your account by clcking the link above.
If you attempt to activate your account or reset your password multiple times, make sure you are using the link in the latest email to set your new password.

Have a great weekend!

Much Love,

Swapsea
