Swapsea - Your Skills Maintenance
=================================

G'day <%= @user.first_name %>,

You have a skills maintenance session this week!

Your session
--------------------
<%= @proficiency.name %>
<%= @proficiency.start.strftime("%A %d %B %Y") %>
<%= @proficiency.start.strftime("%H:%M") %>


Be 15 minutes early
--------------------
We are trying to make the skills maintence sessions run like a well-oiled machine, and avoid any waiting around. To ensure this happens, it would be great if you can be there 15 minutes before the start of your session to get any paperwork out of the way.

Can't make it?
--------------------
We're not mad, we understand life gets in the way sometimes. However, as there are limited spots available for each proficiency, we just ask that you make your spot available for someone else.

To cancel, simply login to Swapsea, and on the proficiencies page, click cancel next to your name.

Have a great weekend!


Much Love,
Swapsea + The Education Team
