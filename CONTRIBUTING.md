# How to contribute to Swapsea

Swapsea is a volunteer effort, just like the Australian lifesaving movement. We encourage you to pitch in and Contribute!

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Swapsea**, and instead please contact help@swapsea.com.au.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Swapsea/swapsea/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Swapsea/swapsea/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Ensure your patch has tests that all pass, and if it breaks existing tests, please include fixes for them too.
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## **Did you format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Nice, thanks!

## **Would you like to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Just open an issue on GitHub, or drop us a line at help@swapsea.com.au and we'll help you make it happen.

Much Love :heart:
